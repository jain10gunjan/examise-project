                      Improve Your Credit Score: A higher credit score can lead
                      to lower interest rates.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Compare Offers: Shop around and compare offers from

                    <li>
                      Consider a Shorter Loan Term: While monthly payments may
                      be higher, a shorter term can reduce overall interest
                      costs.

                      Make a Larger Down Payment: A significant down payment
